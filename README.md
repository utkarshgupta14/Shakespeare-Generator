# Shakespeare-Generator
This is a from scratch implementation of a character level
lanuage model which generates text that resembles 
Shakespeare's writing style.

The project implements a transformer network
using Pytorch and shows the working of
self attention and multi-headed attention blocks.

The result at the end of the notebook
shows text that looks similar to what 
other Shakespeare writings may look like 
but when read carefully, it does not 
actually create logical sentences which 
have a meaning.
